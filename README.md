## Visitor-Management-System

A secure and modern **Visitor Management System** built during my internship at **Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd. (TCIL)**. I enhanced and extended their existing visitor tracking solution to improve efficiency, security, and usability for front-desk operations. The system handles visitor registration, real-time photo capture, host verification, pass printing, and detailed reporting — all through a clean and responsive interface.

The application was successfully deployed for internal use and actively supports daily visitor entries at TCIL headquarters.

*Note: The source code for this project cannot be uploaded to GitHub as it was developed for internal use at TCIL. This repository is intended only to demonstrate the features and UI of the system. All functionalities shown were fully implemented and deployed.*
